As a skilled web developer, I designed and developed a restaurant website using React, a powerful JavaScript library. Leveraging React's component-based architecture,
I created a visually appealing and interactive user experience for visitors.
In this restaurant website add to cart functionality is awesome , users can add food in it and when the users add food than number of food items is increasing . For more , do checkout .....
My development of the restaurant website using React resulted in a visually stunning, interactive, and user-friendly experience. Through careful attention to design, functionality, and responsiveness, 
I successfully contributed to the establishment's ability to attract and engage customers effectively.
